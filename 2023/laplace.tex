\item The circuit shown in the figure is initially in the steady state with the switch K in open condition and $\overline{K}$ in closed condition. The switch K is closed and $\overline{K}$ is opened simultaneously at the instant $t = t_1$, where $t_1 > 0$. The minimum value of $t_1$ in milliseconds such that there is no transient in the voltage across the 100 $\mu F$ capacitor, is \rule{1cm}{0.15mm} (Round off to 2 decimal places) \hfill (GATE EE 2023)

\item $y=e^{mx}+e^{-mx}$ is the solution of which differential equation?

    \item $\frac{dy}{dx} - my = 0$ 
    \item $\frac{dy}{dx} + my = 0$ 
    \item $\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} + m^{2}y = 0$

\item In the differential equation $\frac{dy}{dx} + \alpha x y = 0, \alpha$ is a positive constant. If $y = 1.0$ at
$x = 0.0$, and $y = 0.8$ at $x = 1.0$, the value of $\alpha$ is (rounded off to three decimal places).  \hfill(GATE CE 2023)
